🌸 Iris Flower Classification — End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify Iris flower species based on morphological features such as petal and sepal dimensions. The objective is to build, evaluate, and compare classification models capable of accurately predicting flower species.

The project demonstrates a structured ML workflow including:

1) Data preprocessing
2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3) Feature engineering
4) Model training
5) Performance evaluation
6) Model comparison

This serves as a foundational classification project while applying industry-relevant machine learning best practices.
